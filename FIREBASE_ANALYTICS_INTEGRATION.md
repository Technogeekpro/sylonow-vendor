## Technical Implementation

### Core Service: FirebaseAnalyticsService

**Location**: lib/core/services/firebase_analytics_service.dart

Singleton service with comprehensive tracking methods including:
- Authentication tracking (logLogin, logSignUp)
- Business events (logBookingStatusChanged, logServiceCreated)
- User journey (logOnboardingStep, logOnboardingCompleted)
- App usage (logScreenView, logFeatureUsed)
- Error tracking (logError)

### Router Integration

**Location**: lib/core/config/router_config.dart

Automatic screen view tracking for all navigation using GoRouter observers.

### Provider Integration

**Location**: lib/core/providers/analytics_provider.dart

Analytics service available through Riverpod dependency injection.

## Integration Examples

### Screen Tracking
- Added to initState of key screens (Welcome, Phone, OTP, Home)
- Automatic tracking via router observer

### Feature Usage Tracking
- Button clicks (Google sign-in, phone sign-in, pull-to-refresh)
- Form submissions (phone number, OTP verification)

### Business Event Tracking
- Booking status changes (pending  confirmed)
- Onboarding completion with user properties

### Error Tracking
- Authentication failures with error details
- Business operation errors with context

## Tracked Screens & Features

### Authentication Flow
- Welcome Screen: Screen views, Google/phone sign-in attempts
- Phone Screen: Number submission, validation errors
- OTP Screen: Verification attempts, resend actions, success/failure

### Onboarding Process
- Vendor Registration: Form submission, document upload, completion tracking
- Error Handling: Validation failures, upload errors, duplicate registrations

### Main App Features
- Home Screen: Dashboard views, pull-to-refresh, feature interactions
- Booking Management: Accept/decline actions, error handling
- Navigation: Automatic screen tracking via router observer

## Privacy & Compliance

### Data Collection
- Personal Data: Only user IDs and business types are tracked
- Sensitive Data: No personal information (names, emails, phone numbers) in events
- Business Data: Only aggregate metrics (booking counts, not customer details)

### Debug Mode
- All events include debug logging when kDebugMode is true
- Production builds automatically optimize analytics collection
- Debug logs help verify event tracking during development

## Monitoring & Viewing Data

### Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select project: sylonow-85de9
3. Navigate to Analytics  Events
4. View real-time and historical data

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- User Engagement: Screen views, session duration
- Conversion Funnel: Sign-up  Onboarding  First booking
- Business Metrics: Booking acceptance rates, vendor activity
- Error Rates: Authentication failures, app crashes

## Testing Analytics

### Debug Verification
Run app in debug mode and watch console logs for analytics events like:
-  Screen view tracked: home_screen
-  Login tracked: google
-  Booking status change tracked: booking123, pending  confirmed

### Firebase DebugView
1. Enable debug mode on test device
2. Use Firebase DebugView for real-time event monitoring
3. Verify events are being sent correctly
