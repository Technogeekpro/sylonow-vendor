#Rules 
- Follow the feature first layer approach
- When I tell you to create new feature with any 'name' then create the folder structure as below 

Step 1 => Create folders , screens , providers , controllers , models , widgets ,service
Step 2 => Create model fisrt using the freez and run the command using dart 
step 3 => inside the service folder create service that use supabase to fetch the data and give in form of freezed model that we created using fromJson or toJson
step 4 => create a provider inside the provider folder and make , provider should always be AsyncNotifier with proper error handling 
step 5 => use the provider in screens folder when there is a need of data
Step 6 => create a controller that give control to UI 

- User interface should be minimal and clean 

- Code should be not complex and make seprations properly
